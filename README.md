## Overview

The is a responsive web based TODO application where each user logs in to create a list of TODO's via a rich UI.

Each TODO list starts off with a name provided by the user.  Once all TODO items have been completed, the TODO list moves from the ACTIVE list of TODO's to a COMPLETED (OR ARCHIVED) list of TODO's which the can refer to at any time.

TODO's should be persisted to the database behind the scenes without the user having to actively click a Save button (or something similar).
